## Description:
This is a simple 2D game, a player has to try not to collide with any stuff
that is falling from the sky. A user can move the player character by pressing
the arrow key <-, -> alternatively 'a', 'd' key. You can toggle full-screen mode by pressing
the 'f' key on the title screen. If the player successfully dodges the stuff, a player gets
a corresponding score. As the player scores higher and higher, pieces of stuff are getting faster
and they are going to more frequently be created.
